# Audio-Player-Python
An Audio Player Built With Python


I decided to try and make a simple python audio player with a GUI (tkinter) to challenge myself as I am an amatuer, and I feel like I did pretty good.
This is completely open-source so have a look at it, if you want tell me what I could do better.
And to the people who are similar to my level of skill (Know the general bits of python but can't make anything really cool) I hope this helps you understand a little more about things like pygames audio mixer and tkinter's gui!

Things I imported:
pygames (mixer and time),
tkinter (filedialog and messagebox),
os,
sys (exit)
